# Darkelf Vault Browser ‚Äî PyQt5 (v3)

**Darkelf** is a **fully hardened, privacy-first browser** built on Qt WebEngine.  
It is designed as a **drop-in replacement for Tor Browser**, combining strong fingerprinting defenses, Tor/SOCKS proxy routing, post-quantum crypto, and even **OS-level hardening tools**.  

This README documents the **PyQt5 Vault Browser** editions included here.

## Variants (PyQt5)

| Variant | File | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Darkelf Vault Browser** | `Darkelf Vault Browser.py` | Hardened default build: tracker blocking, HTTPS-only, fingerprinting defenses, Tor/SOCKS proxy support, secure downloads, kernel monitors. |
| **Darkelf Vault TL Edition** | `Darkelf Vault TL Edition.py` | Adds advanced **TLS/Network tooling**: live certificate SHA-256 monitor, TLS fingerprint control (`tls-client`), extra DNS resolvers (DoH/DoT). |

## üî• Darkelf vs Tor Browser

| Feature | **Darkelf Vault Browser v3** | **Tor Browser** |
|---------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Network routing** | SOCKS5/Tor proxy support (127.0.0.1:9050/9052). PAC file support. | Tor network routing by default. |
| **TLS stack** | TLS 1.3 enforced by default. Live SHA-256 certificate monitoring (TL Edition). | Standard Firefox TLS stack. |
| **DNS** | DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) & DNS-over-TLS (DoT) resolvers included (configurable). | Uses Tor exit node resolvers. |
| **Fingerprinting defenses** | Over 40+ injected JS stealth APIs: canvas, audio, WebRTC, plugins, timezone, fonts, performance timers, etc. Tor-style letterboxing spoof. | Tor Browser-level defenses (canvas prompt, letterboxing, UA uniformity). |
| **Crypto bridge** | **DarkelfCrypto**: exposes NaCl, Cryptography, and **ML-KEM 768 (Kyber)** PQC to web pages via QWebChannel. Fully functional, not a demo. | None (no local crypto bridge). |
| **Post-quantum support** | ‚úÖ **Fully working ML-KEM 768 (Kyber) via Open Quantum Safe.** | ‚ùå Not included. |
| **Kernel/system hardening** | DarkelfKernelMonitor: disables dynamic_pager, wipes swapfiles, monitors kernel config. | ‚ùå Not included. |
| **Platform** | PyQt5 (Linux, Windows, macOS). | Firefox ESR (all major OS). |
| **Default search** | DuckDuckGo private search (configurable). | DuckDuckGo onion / local search box. |

üëâ **Summary**: Darkelf matches Tor Browser in anonymity features, **adds post-quantum crypto, TLS/DNS tools, and OS-level hardening.**

## üöÄ Recommended Use Cases

Darkelf is designed for **users who need more than Tor Browser provides**, with particular focus on **post-quantum security, hardened environments, and forensic safety**.  

- **Everyday hardened browsing**  
  Use Darkelf Vault as your default secure browser: tracker blocking, HTTPS-only, stealth APIs, and proxy/Tor support.  

- **Post-quantum research & testing**  
  The **DarkelfCrypto bridge** with **ML-KEM 768 (Kyber)** lets developers and researchers experiment with PQC and hybrid key exchange in a real browser environment.  

- **Forensic & investigative workflows**  
  Built-in **certificate hash monitor** and **DNS/TLS tools** help with network analysis, pinning, and debugging malicious chains.  

- **System-level security environments**  
  On macOS/Linux, **DarkelfKernelMonitor** ensures swap/paging is controlled, preventing memory persistence and reducing side-channel leakage.  

- **Educational use**  
  As a teaching tool, Darkelf demonstrates hardened browser design, cryptographic bridges, and PQC integration in an accessible Python/Qt codebase.
